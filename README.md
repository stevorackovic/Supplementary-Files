SIGGRAPH Supplementary Video and revised Figures

SupVideo.mp4 - Supplementary video showing the results of different methods over a short animation sequence. Meshes of teh reference motion are presented on a left-hand-side, and on the right-hand-side is a mirrored mesh corresponding to the resutls of each specified method. Blue bars show blendshape weihts activations for each frame, for corresponding methods, and orange bars show differences in weights activations for the consecutive frames. We can see that the proposed method, 'Quartic Smooth', is the only one giving both very accurate mesh reconstruction, as well as smooth temporal transitions. 
Figures 1, 2, and 6 will replace the corresponding figures in a revised version of our draft, as suggested by reviewers.
